## Description

_This website take a numb input from the user and returns a range of numbers with certain integers being replaced by robotic speech words and phrases.This is my third independent project at Epicodus, and it is intended to implement arrays and looping. Expected behaviors of this program will include:_

_This program should return a range of numbers from 0 -to the number inputted by the user._

* Example input: 4
* Example output: 0,1,2,3,4

_This program should replace any number containing 3 with the phrase "I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that." This should take precedence over the rules for numbers 2 or 1._

* Example input: 4
* Example output: 0,1,2,I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that.,4

_This program should replace any number containing 2 with the phrase "boop" and should only take precedence over the rule for number 1._

* Example input: 2
* Example output: 0,1,Boop!

_This program should replace any number containing 1 with the phrase "beep" and is the rule with the lowest precedence._

* Example input: 1
* Example output: 0, Beep!
